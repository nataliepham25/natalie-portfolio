# Personal Website

This website was created using React to showcase my projects and skills.
This is version one of my portfolio. When I have time I will be coming back to this version and making changes.
For now, version two will be solely html/css and JavaScript.

TO DO LIST:
- Mobile Compatability
- Change background
- Update Summer and Fall Internships
- Remove Contact info
- Implement Spotify API to showcase coding playlist
- Implement GCP to determine how many people view the website
